# Introduction to High Performance Computing

This repository contains code that performs something similar to the GaussianBlur convolution kernel on a checkerboard image. The respective CW files perform serial and parallel optimisation on the code.

All of this has been run and tested on the supercomputer BlueCrystal Phase 4

Serial Optimisation: Through compiler flags 
Parallelisation: Through OpenMPI

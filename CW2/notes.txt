1. Run between mpicc and mpiicc, choose the latter coz it is naturally faster
2. Find alternative compiler to -fast -> -O3 -xHost
3. Convert all pointers on the image to restrict -> tells the compiler that the respective pointer is the only way
    to access teh object pointed by it and compiler does not need to add any additional checks.

    It is essentially a way for us to inform about any optimisations that compiler can make.

    Does not significantly change the performance of the code

4. Use register variables as counters for innter loops. Variables stored in registers can be accessed
    much faster than the variables stored in memory

5.
